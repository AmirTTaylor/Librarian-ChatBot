Idea:
    - Create an AI chatbot that recommends books to the user
    - User can ask for recommendations based on genre
    - User can ask for recommendations based on books
    - User can ask for recommendations based on author
    - User can save a database of the books the user has read that the chatbot can pull from to make recommendations based on

Progress:
    01/30/26
    - Coded the chatbot and connected a small vector store
    01/31/26
    - Test to see if bot can recommend based on previous read books
        - Is suggesting based on recent reads but not from the database of books provided
        - Ask ChatGpt why, it says the prompt isnt strict enough
    - Ask chatgpt to create a large csv file full of books, Structure: title,description,genre,author,themes,mood
