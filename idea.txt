Idea:
    - Create an AI chatbot that recommends books to the user
    - User can ask for recommendations based on genre
    - User can ask for recommendations based on books
    - User can ask for recommendations based on author
    - User can save a database of the books the user has read that the chatbot can pull from to make recommendations based on

Progress:

    01/30/26
    - Coded the chatbot and connected a small vector store

    01/31/26
    - Test to see if bot can recommend based on previous read books
        - Is suggesting based on recent reads but not from the database of books provided
        - Ask ChatGpt why, it says the prompt isnt strict enough
    - Ask chatgpt to create a large csv file full of books, Structure: title,description,genre,author,themes,mood

    02/07/26
    - Turned chatbot into function call 
    - Added comments
    - Creating a terminal menu with option to talk to chatbot or save previously read books
    - Working on reading and writing from a file that stores books the user has read
    - Successfully allow user to store books theyve read and see a list of those books
    - Store user book history in datbase for chatbot use
    - Add Navigation between pages

    02/010/26
        - Check if user has added books to there library before  showing, if no say that and ask them to add books

    Next I need to ensure the bot is using the csv file and user history
